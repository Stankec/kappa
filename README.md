And the folks behind
[LambdaCI's](https://github.com/lambci/lambci)
[docker-lambda](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda)
project. It's the backbone on top of which this application has been built.

## Why kappa?

Well, if AWS Lambdas are the-bleeding-edgeâ„¢ enabeling 'serverless'
infrastructure then this is a step backwards - back to a server-client
infrasturcture. The Greek letter preceding lambda (Î») is kappa (Îº)...
Very clever, I know ðŸ¤£
